## Overview of the project
### Project: Movie Recommendation System
### Objective:
**The objective of building a Movie Recommendation System is to provide personalized movie suggestions to users based on their preferences, viewing history, or similarities with other users. This system can demonstrate the complete data science workflow, integrating machine learning techniques with a user-friendly interface built using Streamlit.** 

### Key Activities: 
**Data Ingestion and Preprocessing:**

Load a movie dataset using pandas.

Clean and preprocess data by handling missing values, duplicates, or inconsistencies.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Analyze trends like popular genres, top-rated movies, or active users using visualizations.

**Content-Based Filtering:**

Recommend movies similar to a user's liked movies using features like genres, actors, or descriptions.

**Model Training and Evaluation:**

Train machine learning models (e.g., cosine similarity for content-based filtering or matrix factorization for collaborative filtering).

Evaluate the system using metrics like Precision@K, Recall@K, or RMSE.

**Streamlit Interface:**

Build an interactive web app where users can:

Search for movies.

Get recommendations based on their input.

**Deployment:**

Deploy the app .

### Technologies Used:
**Python:** Programming language

**Pandas:** Used for data manipulation

**streamlit :** Used to build and share interactive web apps for data visualization, machine learning, and data science projects. 

**sklearn:** Used for train_test_split and LabelEncoder
